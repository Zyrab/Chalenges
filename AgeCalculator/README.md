## Overview


### The challenge
This HTML file sets up an Age Calculator app. It includes input fields for the user to enter their birthdate (day, month, year), a calculation button, and displays the calculated age in years, months, and days. The associated JavaScript (main.js) handles user input validation, including checking for valid dates and leap years, and displays appropriate error messages when necessary. The age calculation is animated, incrementing from 0 to the calculated age when the "Calculate" button is pressed. Additionally, the code includes comments for clarity, making it easy to understand and maintain.

Key tasks in this challenge:

Create the HTML structure for input fields and age display.
Style the app using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Implement JavaScript for input validation and age calculation.
Animate the age display when the "Calculate" button is clicked.
Ensure the code is well-documented for clarity.
This challenge tests your skills in web development, including form handling, data validation, animation, and responsive design. It's a great opportunity to practice these essential web development concepts.
